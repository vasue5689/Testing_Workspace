1) What is software testing ?
- Testing is a process used to identify correctness, completeness, and quality of developed computer software.

- Also testing is a proces to identify error and bugs in devloped software.

2) What is SDLC ?
- SDLC means "software development lifecycle".
- In SDLC there is 2 main testing.
      1)Static testing : It can test and find the defects without executing code.
      2)Dynamic testing : It can test and find defects with executing code.

3) SDLC Phases / stages
- there is six stages : 
    1) Requirment gathering : It is a functional or non-functional.
    2) Analysis : "what" , "how"
    3) design : In design there is devloper select the design of software.
    4) Implementation : 
    5) Testing : Testing is a process where we define error or mistake and fixed it.
    6) maintenance : In maintenance there are three type:
            1) Corrective : 
            2) Adaptive : send program to a NEW PLATFORM.
            3) Perfective : you can add new requirements or function.

4) what is agile methodology?
  - it is a non stop model.
  - the end of the project is not identify.
  - popular model.
  - iterative approch is taken.

* Pros
  - it is a very realistic approch to software devlopment.
  - promote team work and cross work.
  - easy to manage.
  - gives flexibility to devlopers.
  - minimum rules.
  - no planning reqired 

* Cons 
  - not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
  - more risk of sustainability,maintabillty and exrensibility.
  - is customer not cleared for his requirement than project is run in wrong way.
  - poor model for long and outgoing project.

5) what is SRS?
  - SRS stands for software requirement specification.
  - It includes a set of use case that describe all of the interaction that the user wil
    have with software.
  - it's dependent on behaviour of system to be devloped.
  - it's also contain non-functional  requirement.
  - there are 3 type of SRS
          1) customer requirement
          2) functional requirement
          3) non- functional requirement 

6) what is oops?
  - oop means object oriented programming.
  - programming is like writing, if you can write a demonstration you can make a program.
  - oop is based on object oriented language.
  - inshort oop include object.

7) write basic concepts of oops?
  - oop means object oriented programming.
  - programming is like writing, if you can write a demonstration you can make a program.
  - oop is based on object oriented language.
  - inshort oop include object.

8) what is object?
  - object is a any things what you have like a car,phone,paper etc...
  - object is a basic unit of oop

9) what is class?
  - class means a group of object.
  - like a there is a one phone so it's a object but when i say there is ten phone here so it's a class of phone.
  - class is depend on object.

10) what is encapsulation?
  - Encapsulation is the practice of including in an object everything it needs hidden from other objects. The internal state is usually 
    not accessible by other objects.  
  - encapsulation in java is the process of wrapping up of data. 
  - encapsulation is placing the data and the functions that work on that data in the same place.

11) what is polymorphism?
  - polymorphism means " having many forms".
  - it allows diffrent object to respond to the same message in diffrent ways.
  - the response specific to the type of the object.
  - the abilty to change from is known as polymorphism.
  - there is 2 type of polymorphism in java
          1) compile time polymorphism (overloading)
          2) runtime polymorphism (overriding)

12)explain phases of waterfall model.
  - it is a very well document.
  - clear and fixed.
  - product defination is stable.
  - in waterfall model the project is short.
  - no ambiguous requirements.

* Pros
  - simple and easy to understand.
  - easy to manage due to rigidity.
  - easy to arrange task.
  - it is claer.
  - result is well.
  - project is smaller so easy to understand.

* Cons 
  - high amount of risk.
  - it is difficult to measure.
  - you can use one task in one time so it is complex.
  - uncertainity
  - poo
  - in this model difficult to go forward.

13) write phases of spiral model.
  - risk evolution is important.
  - for medium to high risk project.
  - customer is not sure of their reqirement which are useally the case.
  - significant change are expected.

* Pros
  - changing requirement can be accomodated.
  - requirement can be captured more accuratly.
  - user seethe system early.
  
* Cons
  - managment is more complex.
  - end of project is not early.
  - process is complex.
  - spiral may go indefinitely.
  - not suitable for small project.
